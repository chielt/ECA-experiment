				Thank you for participating in our experiment. If you haven't done so already, feel free to grap a candybar or a 'syrupwaffle'. If you leave behind your e-mail address you will participate in the lucky draw for one of the two 'VVV-checques' which are worth 10 euros each and can be spent in many shops in the Netherlands. Your e-mail address will only be used to contact you in case you've won. If you are interested in our final report, indicate this next to your e-mail address.
